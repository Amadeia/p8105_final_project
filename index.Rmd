## Motivations:

- Currently relevant (e.g. Beto O'Rourke vs. Ted Cruz)
- The midterm elections are about to happen (November 6)
- Comparing voter registration since the last election cycle
- Cross referencing voter registration searches and highly searched political topics
- Political party searches
- Look at geographic components (i.e. where are certain searches occurring)

## Intended Final Products:

- Map of Texas that shows voter registration searches per county
- Graph(s) on trends of voter registration searches and searched political topics by election cycle
- Searches for Beto O'Rourke vs. Ted Cruz for this cycle
- Registration deadline in relation to voter registration searches

## Anticipated Data Sources:

- [Google trends](http://googletrends.github.io/data/)  (downloading the provided csv files) 
- [NY Times Election Results](https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/texas-senate)

## Planned Analyses / Visualizations / Coding Challenges:

- Interactive map (Plotly/Flexdashboard)
      - GIS type of interactive map showing different searches by districts 
- Line graph for timelines
- Bar graph for counties and voter registration searches
- Bar graph for political topic searches (e.g. top 5)
- Finding county level data

# Midterm Election Voter Registration Searches in Texas Using Google Trends

## Motivations:

- Currently relevant (e.g. Beto O'Rourke vs. Ted Cruz)
- The midterm elections are about to happen (November 6)
- Comparing voter registration since the last election cycle
- Cross referencing voter registration searches and highly searched political topics
- Political party searches
- Look at geographic components (i.e. where are certain searches occurring)

## Intended Final Products

- Map of Texas that shows voter registration searches per county
- Graph(s) on trends of voter registration searches and searched political topics by election cycle
- Searches for Beto O'Rourke vs. Ted Cruz for this cycle
- Registration deadline in relation to voter registration searches

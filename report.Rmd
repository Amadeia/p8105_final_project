## <u>Motivation</u> 

Our project goals were to analyze Google Trends data for the 2018 midterm elections. We chose to focus on Texas because of the close race between Beto O’Rourke and Ted Cruz. We wanted to identify the most highly searched political topics and examine different geographic components, such as where certain searches occurred. Our motivation is that this is a currently relevant issue in the U.S. and allows for analyses of civic engagement among American voters. 

## <u>Related Work </u> 

We were inspired to explore this research question due to the high amount of media coverage on the close race between O’Rourke and Cruz. Click [here](http://www.wbur.org/npr/654059869/beto-orourke-ted-cruz-texas-senate) and [here](https://www.vox.com/2018/9/12/17841716/ted-cruz-beto-orourke-senate-midterm) for some articles reported before the midterm election.

A blog website that focuses on using statistical analysis to model poll predictions revealed that they believe O’Rourke might have a chance at winning the race against Ted Cruz. They explained the factors that were looked at in their model predictions [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-why-our-model-thinks-beto-orourke-really-has-a-chance-in-texas/)


## <u>Initial Questions</u>

- How does voter registration for this election compare to previous year’s? Due to the close race between O’Rourke and Cruz, will this increase voter registration? 
- What are the most highly searched political topics and how do they vary by county or district?
- How do political topic searches differ by party (Democrat vs Republican)? 

Over the course of the project, we realized that we only had Google Trends data from September to November 2018, which limited our ability to look at Trend data over time. Consequently, we restricted our analyses to this year’s data, specifically September 2018, and we did not compare 2018 data to that of previous years.

## <u>Data </u>

- Refer to our Data Source Tab for a detailed description of our data sources
- We downloaded CSV files from Google Trends Datastore for data on the top searched issues by US Congressional District
- We scraped election results data from a New York Times article that reported on the midterm elections.

## <u>Exploratory Analysis </u> 

- We created an interactive map of Texas to show voting results by county
- First, we created a bar graph of total votes for each party candidate and found that there were significantly less votes for Dikeman
- Moving forward, we narrowed our results to Ted Cruz and Beto O’Rourke
